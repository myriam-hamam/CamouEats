## Why JSON & localStorage?

- **JSON** provides a lightweight and easy-to-update way to store restaurant menu data without editing HTML directly.  
- **localStorage** ensures that users‚Äô shopping carts persist across page reloads and navigations, enhancing user experience without needing backend support.

## How It Works

1. User visits a restaurant page.  
2. Menu items load dynamically from JSON.  
3. User clicks ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù for desired items.  
4. Cart data (items, quantities, restaurant info) is saved in `localStorage`.  
5. User navigates to the Checkout page, where cart contents are loaded and totals are calculated.  
6. User confirms order by clicking ‚ÄúPlace Order‚Äù.
